# Welcome to Git Flow Manager (GFM)

GFM is a tool designed to assist with implementation programatically of the [`gitflow`](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) approach to version control. This tool provides a set of commands to help you manage your git repositories in a more structured way and is designed to be used in conjunction with a local install of `git` and wrapped by LLM (Large Language Model) tools.

For full documentation, see the [API Reference](reference/gfm/).
